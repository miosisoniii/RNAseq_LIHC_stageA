# RNAseq_LIHC_stageA
RNA-seq Differential Expression analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Liver Cancer Hepatocellular Carcinoma (LIHC) controlled dataset.

The purpose of this git repository is to document the Differential Expression analysis of the TCGA LIHC dataset, using the CGC API to download the Ballgown output files for subsequent processing in R.

# Step 01 - Connect to Cancer Genomics Cloud API
Connect to CGC API and download Ballgown transcript files

# Step 02 - Overlap DEG Stratified by Race
Clean differentially expressed gene lists for each race and write to csv.
